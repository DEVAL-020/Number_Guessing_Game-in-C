# Number_Guessing_Game-in-C
It is a simple classic game project that generates a random number and asks the player to guess it. If the player's guess is higher than the actual number, the program displays "Lower number please". Similarly, if the user's guess is too low, the program prints "Higher number please". User guesses the correct number then, display number of guesses.
